# GenlabJ
A Java framework for genetic algorithms

This initial version of GenlabJ was written to complete programming exercise 1 in Melanie Mitchell's _An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms_. But by the time I'd finished I realised I'd written a general framework for solving any number of exercises, so I thought I'd publish it here.

My eventual plan is to develop this framework so that I can use it to generate human-quality haiku :-). In the meantime instructions on how to use the current framework will follow.

A flock of seagulls
On a ploughed field; white petals
Ruffled by the wind.
